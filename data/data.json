    "question": "Consider SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE val2 > ALL( ...subquery... ). If table1 has rows with val2 in [8, 6, 2], which rows remain?",
    "answer": "Rows where val2 is greater than all returned subquery values, e.g., val2 > 8 in that set.",
    "explanation": "ALL requires the outer row’s val2 to exceed every value in the subquery. If subquery values are 8, 6, 2, val2 must be > 8."

    "question": "While designing a query you determine that some data needs to be preprocessed before your main query. Which of the following is most appropriate?",

    "question": "What is the result of SELECT cod1, (SELECT MAX(val2) FROM table1) - val2 AS DIFF FROM table1 WHERE val1 = 10?",
    "answer": "It returns cod1 and the difference between the global max(val2) and val2, for only those rows where val1 = 10.",
    "explanation": "The subquery gets the maximum val2 in the entire table; subtracting val2 shows how far each row’s val2 is from the max."
